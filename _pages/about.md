Hello! I am Mr. Lost, A Sophomore at IIT Bombay pursuing Engineering Physics. Initially, I wanted to be a Theoretical Physicist but turns out it was just a big Big Bang Theory effect and am currently exploring all fields including Non-Core.

I was a TT State Player and I am a borderline maniacal Formula-1 enthusiast!
